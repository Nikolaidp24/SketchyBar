# [SketchyBar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar)

Sketchybar is a highly customisable open source tool for MacOS, acting as a replacement for the default system menu bar, it's very versatile and I'm starting to try it out recently. Here you can find my configuration files mainly written in shell.

My setup as of right now is basically a merge of all the wonderful plugins that you can find on the thread of SketchyBar plus some minor tweaks, so thanks to all these awesome people.

Please feel free to clone if you want to try it out for yourself.
